# Summary

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by OECD intended to evaluate education system. Schools in sixty-five countries and economies participated in PISA in 2002. As we can see from the visualization, most of the schools participated in PISA in European countries were from towns or small towns, in the contrast, most of the schools participated in PISA in Asian countries were from large cities.   

**Map**: the reason for choosing map as the chart type is because information from more than 60 countries need to be displayed. A geographic map would be more clear and informative as it could give readers a sense of the difference across continents.

**Size of the circle**: to indicate the number of the schools

**Color of the circle**: to indicate if the reader has placed the mouse on the circle, in order to see detailed information

**Color of the button**: to indicate if a button is pressed by a reader



# Feedback

1. There is lack of author driven results and the heading for the visualisation is not specified. 
2. The interactive part of the visualsation is very convenient for readers to explore. The map visualisation is very informative. 
3. I like the color choice for different visual elements. The interval of the animation is not long enough for readers to interpret the results on the map.



# Discussion

I agree that the author driven results are missing and before readers starting explore, heading for the visualisation is missing as well. Therefore, author driven results (i.e., the animation) are added to my second version.



It is a very good feedback pointing out that the interval of animation is too short, therefore, I increase the time of interval in animation a bit in the next version.
